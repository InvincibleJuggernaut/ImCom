<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p> This repository implements lossless image compression using Haar Transform which is categorized under Discrete Wavelet Transforms. It breaks the signal into two components namely, average and difference. The average operation produces the <i>approximation coefficients</i> and the difference operation produces <i>detail coefficients</i>.
